# reactnativeios

i did follow this link to integrate existing app with react native
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html

I was having problem with fishhook.h file and i haven't solve it yet. As i only have 1 month experience in reactnative and i did create one app in android using react native but we have't use it for IOS platform.

i did complete requirement. if you manage to fix fishhook.h than my code will run.
